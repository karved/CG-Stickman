# CG-Stickman
Computer Graphics course work project where our team displayed a story using animation with the help of **C++**.
The story was about a *Life of a Stick-man* which is a satire to the phase of life faced by engineering students after their 10th grade.

Animation was made possible by including ```graphics.h```. It is supported by **Borland Turbo C** IDE and we used the same to complete our project.
